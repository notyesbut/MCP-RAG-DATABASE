**Resolution Required:** Fix syntax errors before any API functionality can work.

### 2. BLOCKER: MCP Registry Coordination Failure
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Multi-MCP workflows broken  

- **Error Pattern:** "MCP user-mcp not found in registry"
- **Affected Tests:** 8/17 integration tests failing
- **Impact:** Cross-MCP query coordination non-functional

**Resolution Required:** Fix MCP registry initialization and coordination.

### 3. HIGH: Performance Optimizer Runtime Error
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Performance monitoring broken  

- **File:** `src/intelligence/performance_optimizer.ts:254`
- **Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hitRate')`
- **Impact:** Auto-rebalancing and performance optimization non-functional

**Resolution Required:** Fix undefined cache performance metrics.
