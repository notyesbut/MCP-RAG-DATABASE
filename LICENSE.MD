– maintain an **active GitHub Sponsor or Open Collective tier** supporting the project at **USD 500 per month or more**.
• **Revenue cap** – the legal entity (together with its parent and subsidiaries) has **annual gross revenue below USD 50 million**; and
• **Openness cap** – any derivative work deployed remains **Open Source under an OSI‑approved license**, and its complete corresponding source code is published in a public repository.

Production Use that does not meet all the above criteria — including deployment of a Cloud Service without satisfying the contribution requirement, use by entities above the revenue cap, or deployment of a **closed‑source** derivative — **is prohibited until the Change Date**, unless a separate commercial license is obtained from the Licensor.
